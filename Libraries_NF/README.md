# C Utility Libraries for Advanced Functions

## Description
This repository contains a collection of C libraries designed to provide useful utilities for advanced C programming. These libraries are intended to make it easier for developers to implement common functionalities, such as working with objects, managing memory, and performing other advanced operations. The libraries provide a structured approach to add object-oriented features to C, simulating object creation and manipulation using data structures and methods.

Each library is modular, meaning you can easily integrate them into your own projects to extend C's capabilities with higher-level abstractions and functionality.

### Example of Libraries Included:
- **`objutil.h` / `objutil.c`**: Simulates object-oriented programming (OOP) in C by providing structures to manage objects with attributes and methods.
- (Include additional libraries here as necessary)

## -- Features
- Simulated object-oriented programming (OOP) in C.
- Simple API for defining and managing objects with attributes and methods.
- Enhanced memory management tools and utilities.
- Designed to simplify common programming tasks in C and enhance code reusability.

## -- Usage

### -- Example of `objutil` Library

Here is an example of how to use the `objutil` library to create and manipulate objects in C:

1. **Include the library**:

```c
#include "objutil.h"
